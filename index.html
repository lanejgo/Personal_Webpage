      <div>I am a University of Washington student studying English and Technical Writing in Seattle. In June 2023, I will graduate Cum Laude from UW after only attending for three years,
        but I will continue to take classes during the summer. My work includes web development through HTML and CSS, as well as writing genres like white papers, FAQs, and manuals. I am
        currently searching for an entry-level Technical Writing position where I can get professional experience in the field of my interest.</div>
